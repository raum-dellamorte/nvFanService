# nvFanService
### Running Wayland and can't use GreenWithEnvy? Relax. Raum brings Fan Service to your nVidia GPU.
No promises. But it just may work.

## Currently:
- Fan speeds are hard coded
- We're printing the temp and fan speed to the terminal every 10 seconds
- It seems to work on Nobara 40 (Fedora 40 ala GloriusEggroll)
- press 'q' then 'Enter' to quit.

Good talk...
